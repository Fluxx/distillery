h2. What

This module is to extract the text from web page ( html content ).

( except for menu, comments, navigations, affiliate links and so on ).

h2. The basics

- separating blocks from html, calculating score of blocks and ignoring low score blocks.
- for score calculation, using block arrangement, text length, whether has affiliate links or characteristic keywords
- clustering continuous, high score blocks and comparing amang clusters
- if including "Google AdSense Section Target", noticing it in particular
