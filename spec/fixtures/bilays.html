Growing up, I never gave bialys much thought. The bagel shop where I briefly worked in high school had us front-end people take bagels off the machine rollers, pinch together the centers, schmear them with the onion filling and leave them on a tray for the professionals to bake, and that was about far as I&#8217;d considered them &#8212; a bagel variant. Oh, and that they were excellent toasted with salted butter.</p>
<p>It was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767905024?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0767905024">The Bialy Eaters</a>, Mimi Sheraton&#8217;s pursuit of the chewy, onion-topped <i>kuchen</i> from Bialystok, Poland to Paris, Argentina and Miami Beach, Florida, that was a turning point for me. Although though the book is true to the subject at hand &#8212; bialys &#8212; the subtext is really about the narratives from the scattered remnants of Bialystok &#8212; only a handful survived the pogroms and Holocaust &#8212; recalling what they can about the rolls they used to make and eat. I hadn&#8217;t realized exactly how scarce they were, and became a little obsessed.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not from New York City, you probably have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about. You&#8217;ve probably heard of <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/09/bronx-worthy-bagels/">bagels</a>, I&#8217;m sure, but bialys, often sold in the same shops, but usually relegated to a neglected lower shelf, rarely get any love. As well most of them shouldn&#8217;t, as the state of the current bialy in New York City, or at least Manhattan (I hear there is a place worth checking out in Brooklyn and will keep you posted) is less than ideal &#8212; most are spongy with weak indentations, and if you get more than two scrap of onion in the center, you&#8217;ve beaten the odds. Even <a href="http://www.kossarsbialys.com/">Kossar&#8217;s Bialys</a> on Grand Street in the Lower East Side, which Sheraton had proclaimed the most authentic and best current example of bialys in New York City has gone downhill, with her softening her praise in 2007 to say that <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/food/2007/09/bialy_expert_says_kossars_not.html">&#8220;times have changed.&#8221;</a> (P.S. The pletzels there are still delicious.)</p>

<p>As you can see, bialys are crying out to be made at home, and out of the blue, likely due to a rare combination of deadlines having been met and having already gone to the gym, I decided Thursday was the day. I was thrilled to discover that <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/smitten-20/detail/0393057941">Rose Levy Beranbaum&#8217;s Bread Bible</a> had a version, and that she learned her recipe and technique from a baker at Kossar&#8217;s. (Yes, the same Kossar&#8217;s, but nearly ten years ago, when it&#8217;s reputation was intact.) Because they didn&#8217;t require boiling before baking, they were especially easy to make. And although I will never know if they do the originals any justice, we thought they were perfect &#8212; chewy and soft, onions caramelized and impossible to resist.</p>

<p><b>Bialys</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/smitten-20/detail/0393057941">The Bread Bible</a></p>
<p>The dough of bagels and bialys is very similar &#8212; both are chewy and intense &#8212; but bagels have a crisp outer shell that comes from boiling them before they&#8217;re baked, and bialys have a soft, chewy crust. It has a springy soft crumb and a floury crust, and they don&#8217;t keep long at all. You should either make them for the day you want them or pop them quickly into the freezer so they taste as fresh as possible when you&#8217;re ready for them.</p>
<p>Yield: Six 4 x 1 1/4-inch high bialys or six flat 5 x 1-inch high bialys</p>
<p>2 cups (10.5 ounces/300 grams) King Arthur high-gluten bread flour, preferably, or bread flour<br />
1/2 teaspoon (1.6 grams) instant yeast<br />
1 teaspoon (6.6 grams) salt (the more authentic bialys I have had use a bit more salt, so feel free to dial it up if you like a saltier roll)<br />
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (7.25 ounces/206 grams) water, at room temperature</p>
<p><u>Onion-Poppy Seed Filling</u><br />
2 1/4 teaspoons vegetable oil<br />
6 tablespoons (1.5 ounces, 43 grams) onion, chopped<br />
3/4 teaspoon poppy seeds (I love poppy seeds on a bialy, but this did seem more than I was used to; I might dial it back next time)<br />
1/4 teaspoon sea salt<br />
Black pepper to taste</p>
<p>1. <b>Mix the dough.</b> In the bowl, whisk together the flour and the yeast, then whisk in the salt (this keeps the yeast from coming in direct contact with the salt which would kill it). With the dough hook, on low speed (#2 if using a KitchenAid), gradually add the water, mixing for about 1 minute or until the flour mixture is moistened. Raise the speed to medium (#4 KitchenAid) and continue mixing for 7 minutes. The dough should clean the bowl but be soft and elastic. Add a little extra flour or water if necessary. (The dough will weigh about 17.75 ounces/506 grams).</p>
<p>2.<b>Let the dough rise.</b> Place the dough in a 1 1/2-quart or larger dough-rising container or bowl, lightly greased with cooking spray or oil. Press down the dough and lightly spray or oil the top. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap. With a piece of tape, mark the side of the container at approimately where double the height of the dough would be. Allow the dough to rise, ideally at 75 to 80&#176;F, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until it has doubled.</p>
<p>3. <b>Shape the dough and let it rise.</b> Deflate the dough by firmly pushing it down, and transfer it to a floured counter. Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (about 3 ounces, 84 grams each). Work with one piece at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered. Maintaining as much air as possible in the dough, round each piece by pulling the dough together to form a pouch, stretching to make a smooth skin, and pinching it together where the edges meet. Set it on a floured baking sheet or tray, pinched side down. (The rounds will be 2 1/2 inches by 1 1/2 inches high.) Flour the tops and cover with plastic wrap.</p>
<p>Allow the bialys to rise for about 2 hours at 75 to 80&#176;F or until almost doubled; when pressed lightly in the center, they should keep the impression. If the dough is underrisen, it will puff up in the center instead of maintaining the characteristic hollow crater. The trick for underrisen dough is to make a small hole in the center before adding the filling. Since the dough bakes so quickly, it&#8217;s easy to test bake one to see if the dough is ready. If you want to be on the safe side, make the hole anyway.</p>
<p>4. <b>Make the onion-poppy seed filling.</b> In a small saute pan, heat the oil. Add the onion and saute over medium heat, stirring often, for about 5 minutes or until translucent. (I went longer, going for a deeper caramelization but you should cook them to your taste.) Remove from the heat and add the poppy seeds, salt, and pepper to taste. Cool.</p>
<p>5. <b>Preheat the oven.</b> Preheat the oven to 475&#176;F 30 minutes before baking. have an oven shelf at the lowest level and place a baking stone or baking sheet on it, and a sheet pan on the floor of the oven, before preheating.</p>
<p>6. <b>Make the craters for the filling.</b> Holding each piece of dough with both hands, with your thumbs in the middle and almost touching, pinch the center of the dough tightly between your thumbs and first two fingers and stretch the dough to 4 1/2 to 5 inches in diameter, forming a crater in the center. (My pinching skills are not up to par and my centers puffed a bit. No biggie, but make sure you get a good firm pinch in there!) Place it on the lined baking sheet and spoon 1 teaspoon of onion-poppy seed filling into the center.</p>
<p>7. <b>Bake the bialys.</b> Place the baking sheet with the bialys directly on the hot oven stone or hot baking sheet, or, if using parchment, use a peel or a cookie sheet to slide the parchment with the bialys onto the stone or sheet. Toss a handful of ice cubes into the sheet pan on the oven floor (this helps make your oven closer to a professional bread oven; the steam helps form a crust), and immediately shut the door. Bake for 6 to 10 minutes or until pale golden and mottled with brown spots (an instand-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 211&#176;F.)</p>
<p>8. <b>Cool the bialys.</b> Remove the baking sheet or parchment from the oven and, with a pancake turner, transfer the bialys to wire racks to cool until just warm.</p>
<p><b>Storage:</b> The bialys keep well for one day at room temperature in a paper bag. For longer storage, wrap each in airtight plastic wrap and place freezer bags in the freezer for up to one month. Thaw, still wrapped, at room temperature.</p>
<p><b>Variation:</b> To make crisper flat bialys (a favorite in New York, I did not do this but might next time), brush the tops with a mixture of 1 large egg white beaten with 1/2 teaspoon water and sprinkle with poppy seeds (use 3 times the weight of the egg white in poppy seeds). Cover with plastic wrap and press down on the bialys with a sheet pan or cookie sheet to make 5 1/2- to 6-inch rounds. Remove the plastic wrap and use the wide end of a chopstick to make about 12 holes in each bialy. Bake as above, but add a few minutes to that bialys turn golden brown.</p>

				<p>I love bialys, have always liked them better than bagels, and haven&#8217;t had a good one in years.  I used to think they were a cross between a bagel and an english muffin, because they have to be split and toasted.  So perfect with lox and cream cheese.  Thanks for the recipe and the inspiration to try making them!</p>

				<p>Hurrah for bialys!  I&#8217;m an equal opportunity bagel-ist, so I give bialys their rightful place in my Sunday bagel rotation.  It&#8217;s wonderful to be able to just make them at home.  Thanks for the recipe!</p>

				<p>These are awesome.  For some reason i was under the impression that you had to boil them, but maybe that is becuase Noah&#8217;s Bagels sells them right next to bagels&#8230; I attempted bagels and the dense texture is hard to ascertain.  Perhaps I should just switch to bialys. Anyhow, I would try different toppings. </p>
<p>Perhaps adding a strong cheese or even using white poppy seeds, which I discovered at the indian bizarre.  I do love theme and variation.</p>

				<p>I love bialys, but I&#8217;m never quite sure how to eat them. Because they appear in bagel-related situations, I always want one split and filled with cream cheese (and lox, and capers, and red onions, and&#8230;) but they&#8217;re too awkward for that. So I just chew on them. I&#8217;m in the pro-poppy camp&#8211;the more the merrier. And bring on them caramelized onions&#8230;</p>

				<p>I haven&#8217;t had a bialy in years, but remember well the bagel shop in Park Slope near my grandparents&#8217; house. We used to go every Sunday for bagels and bialys, but as a kid I didn&#8217;t like the onions and would pick them off. When I read Mimi Sheraton&#8217;s book, I thought about those bialys. Now I&#8217;m thinking about making them.</p>

				<p>Thank you! I love bialys. It&#8217;s actually the main thing I miss from New York. I used to get them toasted with cream cheese and tomato. I&#8217;m sure not the traditional way to eat them but the onion in the bialy made it so good.</p>

				<p>I, being the mid-western native I am, have never had a bialys.  I&#8217;ve read about them in books, seen them on television shows, dreamed about hitting a real-live bagel shop or Eastern European bakery and stuffing myself into oblivion.  But for some reason it never occured to me to try making them at home.  And trust me when I say that is an unusual ommitance.  I will remedy that this afternoon.</p>

				<p>You just reminded me of my favorite sandwich of all time, forever and ever, amen! There was a bagel shop in Orange County that had a Reuben on an onion-smothered bialy that would just make me die and go to heaven sixteen times by the time I was done. The shop is gone now, and I am living in New Mexico anyway, but I could make these! You just made my day!</p>

				<p>Oh man I haven&#8217;t had a bialy in forever.  In high school the student government used to deliver bagels and bialys to our first hours from this fantastic shop across the street.  They&#8217;d come in big paper bags still hot, and I&#8217;d dig through the bag to find the ONE bialy they&#8217;d throw in the mix.  (Everyone else would be scrambling for the cinnamon raisin bagels.  Pass.)  I gained a crap ton of weight from those carbs and my breath would be gross for the rest of the day but no matter to me, I already had a boyfriend. ;)</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m with #14&#8211;David.  How do you toast these without all of the onion toppings just spilling out and burning in your toaster?  Do you split them?  There&#8217;s an artisan bagel shop near my house that sells bialys.  Maybe I&#8221;ll just go there sometime and order one toasted with butter and see how they do it&#8230;.</p>

				<p>Deb &#8212; </p>
<p>I am from NYC and LOVE bialys&#8230; My only question is what the insides of these look like. My association is that bialys should have a much more open crumb than bagels &#8212; almost like the nooks and crannies of an English muffin. Is that how these turn out?</p>

				<p>I may just try this recipe as is because the bialys look so good, but any thoughts on using whole wheat flour?  How about sprouted grains?  Has anyone found any kind of sprouted flour in a store and not had to order it online?</p>

				<p>Abcgirl &#8212; Excellent question! So, Mimi Sheraton says in her bialy book that whatever schmear you use is supposed to go across the top, not split and in the inside, which pretty much <i>blew my bialy-loving mind</i> when I read that. I&#8217;ve tried it, though, and even if it is the &#8220;right&#8221; way, I cannot get into it. I split mine. </p>
<p>Also necessary to note: My pinching skills are not up to par and the centers puffed. No effect taste-wise, but you should see more of a pressed-in center, so if split horizontally, the onion often stays with the bottom half and the top almost looks like a bagel ring. </p>
<p>I like to toast mine whole and split them while warm, to keep the insides soft and chewy (it also crisps the outside, again, not &#8220;correct&#8221; but freakin&#8217; delicious). Any and all onion bits lost in the split should be summarily scooped back onto the now-buttered or cream cheese-ed surfaces. [P.S. Eating one like this right now and <i>guuuuh</i>, so good.]</p>
<p>Tobey &#8212; Totally not facetious! See how blue the centers of my bialys look? That&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re supposed to look like. I mean, love love love poppy seeds but I think a smaller amount would look more &#8220;authentic.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I learned about bialys at a little coffee shop in Ashland, Oregon; the owner was from Brooklyn and makes the best bagels you can buy in southern Oregon (not the same as Manhattan, but perfectly acceptable). When I worked there one summer, I found a copy of The Bialy Eaters on a bookshelf in the shop.</p>
<p>Now I live in L.A., and one of my favorite places to eat is Nate &amp; Al&#8217;s deli. I have no idea what their bagels taste like, because I always order a bialy&#8230;</p>

				<p>The bialys from my childhood were NEVER brushed with egg whites.  They were always a &#8220;flat&#8221; (as opposed to glossy) finish, and also had a ubiquitous coating of white flour.</p>
<p>I could do a dissertation on bialys as I have done on bagels in the past.</p>

				<p>Oh, I love Bailys; thanks for posting this!  </p>
<p>One hint I learned from a fabulous Saveur bagel recipe years ago is that adding a bit of vital wheat gluten to the flour can allow you to use lower-gluten flours without skewing the recipe.  IIRC, the proportion is 1-2 t gluten per cup of flour.</p>

				<p>I JUST bought bialys after getting slammed with a major craving. I know they won&#8217;t be as good as these&#8211;I can already tell that the ones i bought are too light and fluffy, not chewy.<br />
There used to be a bagel place in Irvington, NJ that sold the best bialys. We would go there after visiting my grandparents and buy bags full of them. Then we had to eat them fast-toasted with salted butter-before they went stale.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m of the &#8220;never heard of them&#8217; school, but I&#8217;m happy to learn!  I like the idea that they are in the bagel family but not as tough and don&#8217;t need boiling.  Six minute bake time sounds great too!  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m in CA where there are many Noah&#8217;s Bagles shops around.  Frankly, their bagels don&#8217;t have the texture of any bagel I&#8217;d ever eaten before;  they are too soft.  It&#8217;s not a bad thing, I like them, but they didn&#8217;t have the dense chewy texture of the bagels I had eaten when I lived in the DC area.   When I read the description of bialys it brought to mind my impression of Noah&#8217;s bagels.  Are the textures similar in your opinion?</p>

				<p>Hello,<br />
I was born in Bialystok and I live  here for over 23 years&#8230; I`m totally suprised. I really don`t know what to say&#8230; Bialys here, in my city, don`t have such lovely name. We usually named them &#8216;cebularze&#8217;, &#8216;cebulaczki&#8217; (this names are taken from &#8216;cebula&#8217; which means in polish &#8216;onion&#8217;). They are usually made (in my family!) when somehow we have to much yeast dought. ;-) They are casual&#8230; I`ve never thought that their have so long and complicated history. I`m glad that they are so popular! :-)</p>
<p>And you know, when I prepare bialys (or something like bialys) I put onion filling into the bun not only on the top. Bo it is my idea&#8230; But also tasty! :-)</p>

				<p>So here I am, taking a five minute break from WORKING on a Sunday &#8211; boo &#8211; and I find this post. Those bialys. Those bialys. Those bialys! How am I supposed to get any work done AT ALL with those bialys floating around my head?!? CA is great in a lot of ways, but finding a decent bagel is next to impossible (Noah&#8217;s? Blech, no.). And I doubt I have ever had a proper bialy, although my college roomate has had me coveting them for the last 20 years, ever since she flew some back to school from the East coast. I&#8217;m a free woman as of next weekend, and I will. have. bialys.</p>

				<p>I have never lived one day of my life in NYC and I was brought up on bialys. First in Los Angeles as a kid, and now in Boston as an adult. LOVE THEM. Love the caramelized onion and teeny bit of complementary poppy seed. Love them sliced with a schmear and some nova. Love them with unsweetened butter melted on the bottom. Love them plain. </p>
<p>And now I will back them. I do make bagels, which are a PITA, and I have other bialy recipes to compare to, but if you swear by these, I&#8217;m IN.</p>

				<p>Hey Tone &#8211; Wondering why you&#8217;re creeped out by a comment from one of the King Arthur Flour bakers. I&#8217;m a baker/blogger there &#8211; very cool employee-owned company, and we totally love to bake&#8230; nothing wrong with that, eh? Deb, TX so much for this recipe &#8211; I&#8217;ve made bialys in the past and have never been pleased. Your pics look more like what I was going for, so I&#8217;ll try it again. Haven&#8217;t had a good bialy since 1974. PJH</p>

				<p>Oh, my, although I&#8217;ll not be baking much very soon, being temporarily one-handed after hand surgery last week, I&#8217;m glad you posted this so that I could sit here dreaming a dream of bialys.  My last bialys were from, of all places, the Whole Foods near Dupont Circle in D.C., and were surprisingly close to the ones I got 15 years ago from a bakery on Main Street in Flushing.  I had little trouble somewhat bashfully finishing off three or four for dinner.  Sometimes split, sometimes whole, always with butter.  The things I sacrifice living in SLC!</p>

				<p>Why have a bialy when you could have an H&amp;H bagel? That was always my thought&#8230;.And, now, in LA, it&#8217;s come down to lousy bagels unless one wants to go to Barney&#8217;s where there&#8217;s a v. fancy Barney Greengrass (an oxymoron?) and buy not-quite-cooked H&amp;H bagels for not-quite-a-song. Bialys in LA? I saw a couple once in a Starbucks, and they looked like they&#8217;d been made on Ellis Island, circa more than a century ago. I passed (obviously), but will try your recipe, which makes my mouth water. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Mommy Amy and Eliza &#8212; Actually, I pronounce them differently, the way Merriam-Webster suggests: \b&#x113;-<span class="unicode">&#x2C8;</span>a-l&#x113;\</p>
<p> or &#8220;bee-ah-lee&#8221;. Hope that helps. [P.S. I had to hack the m-w.com site just to get those pronunciation codes in there! Quite pleased with self, actually.]</p>
<p>Poswix &#8212; I never expected an actual Bialystoker to comment, and am thrilled to find one out there. Thanks for the name and suggestions.</p>
<p>King Arthur comments &#8212; Thanks, but I&#8217;m going to be completely honest: My very kind and fewer-typo-making husband typed up this recipe for me from that book and I hadn&#8217;t realized that the recipe insisted on King Arthur Bread Flour. (You&#8217;ll recognize the recipes I type myself as having typo after typo in them!) Now, I love King Arthur Bread Flour and use it at home, but I might have added that I suspect many types of bread flour will work, so it is only fair for me to update with that comment. I don&#8217;t like to prop any individual brand over others on this site unless I am sure that no other will do.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s like you read my mind sometimes.<br />
In our freezer section of Publix her in Florida, they have the only bagels I like, Ray&#8217;s from New York (I had one for breakfast today).<br />
I saw these other things called bialys and wondered what they were! So now I will try them and see if they are delish. Alas, I will not make my own, because as I&#8217;ve been told by New Yorkers about the bagels, it&#8217;s the water in NY that makes them the best :)</p>

				<p>Good to see a recipe for them. I&#8217;m in Portland, OR and one of our local grocers makes them daily. They are packed with onions and delicious. I don&#8217;t have anything to compare them too; having never been to New York for a proper bialy. I have a feeling these would hold their own with an NYC bialy. </p>
<p>If you ever decide to visit Portland keep your eyes open for a New Seasons Market and you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>

				<p>OK, I&#8217;m probably not going to make these (although I&#8217;ve made more recipes from your site than ANY other one I read), but I LOVE the photos! Did you take a food photo class? Or have you just picked it up along the way?</p>

				<p>I can&#8217;t believe you posted this! It&#8217;s great!  We JUST heard of bialys last night and I was going to embark on a mission to find some here in Utica.  Now I can make them!  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m from a family of New Yorkers and I love me a good bialy!  Living in DC, I was going to add that Whole Foods carries them with their bagels in their bakery section.  But I see Lenore already said that.  They are a pretty good example of what a bialy tastes like for those of you who haven&#8217;t had one (or even heard of them) before.  </p>
<p>Thanks for the recipe, Deb.  Cannot wait to try it out!</p>

				<p>deb, i also split my bialys. always have and always will. </p>
<p>as for anyone else wondering how to toast them: i split them right above the onion-y goodness (so you get one solid half, one half with a hole) and then you toast them flat (not upright).</p>

				<p>Bialys&#8230;.delicious!  If you&#8217;ve ever in Detroit (though admittedly, not a popular destination), there is an amazing bagel place called (what else) New York Bagel, which makes a square bialy called a &#8220;New Yorker.&#8221; PLENTY of onion and poppy, and delicious just out of the oven&#8230;or split and made into a sandwich.</p>

				<p>I haven&#8217;t thought of these in years.  I do remember they were delicous &#8211; a cross between a bagel and the onion boards my aunt brought from Boston.  I may have to try these right after Passover (and ship a couple to my dad)!</p>

				<p>I am a bialy-over-bagel-any-day-of-the-week kind of girl, but it has never occurred to me to even try making them at home. This is very exciting, especially since the ones at my corner coffee cart leave a little something to be desired. If you find out about this place in brooklyn, please pass along the name so I can visit!</p>

				<p>Hi, Deb!  Quick question about the flat version: at what stage do you smush them with the baking sheet?  After stretching into a ball?  After forming the crater in the center?  And where do you poke the 12 holes&#8211;around the edges?  Ok, so that was more like 4 quick questions.  Sorry.  Icebox cupcakes were completely inhaled last weekend, though!</p>

				<p>Ah, this is so great!  I grew up on the west coast where we had Noah&#8217;s Bagels&#8230;not the greatest representation of the bagel (they were giant and had no hole) but the best we had.  My mom used to buy bialys from them which I actually remember to be pretty decent, but I&#8217;m curious to make a real one and compare the two.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been lurking on your site for quite a while (sometimes unable to get the ingredients you call for because I&#8217;m living in Germany at the moment! Boo!). As a native New Yorker, I am now determined to try your bialy recipe&#8211;there&#8217;s a ton of good bread here, but nothing exactly like a bialy. I&#8217;m also intrigued by the Swiss Easter Rice Tart (I actually just started my own blog and posted about Switzerland&#8211;cheese in particular&#8211;myself, so I&#8217;m on a roll!). Your site is fantastic&#8211;I often look to it for inspiration before heading out to the market. I like funny and food together.</p>

				<p>My affair with bialys was brief&#8230;too brief. My wonderful Jewish uncle from Skokie introduced our family to them in the 1990s. My Dad would always bring some back with him after a visit to Uncle Harry&#8217;s to our home in Central Illinois. Wow, they were fabulous. It was soon after that we could buy them at the grocery store, but that did not last for very long. Unsure of the reason. Thanks for a stroll down memory lane.</p>

				<p>Deb&#8230;&#8230;.I love a good bialy.  Having lived and worked in the Big Apple I grew fond of these and now realize just how much I miss them.  Your picture with the caramelized onions is what did it. </p>
<p>Thanks for bringing back fond memories.  Now, I&#8217;ve got to add these to my list of things that need to be thoroughly investigated. YUM</p>

				<p>these look lovely, and i&#8217;m missing a taste of my new york home out here in oregon.  but a best-eaten-day-of brunch food and a 5 hour prep time is a difficult combo &#8212; can the dough be refrigerated at some point towards the end of the process to allow for a hot breakfast at breakfast time?  or will that ruin some essential bialy characteristics?</p>

				<p>Just about any bread dough can be refridgerated at any point in the prep, before the first rise, after the first rise, second rise, etc. All you need to do is get it back to room temperature when you take them out and then continue from wherever you left off &#8212; about to deflate, in need of a rise or whatnot. </p>
<p>The only reason I, personally, don&#8217;t do this more often is that it always takes an hour or two to get doughs back to room temperature. In that hour or two, I could have started the recipe from the beginning! But, it does safe you a bit of work the second day. And a longer rise always leads to a better-developed flavor.</p>
<p>JS &#8212; I would assume you do this right before you bake them. I haven&#8217;t tried this method but when I saw it in the book, I figured it was worth mentioning for those more loyal to flat, crispier bialys. Do let us know how it goes if you try it.</p>

				<p>Another classic NY food that I didn&#8217;t realize was such a regional specialty until I left the area.  We always got these from our usual &#8220;bagel place&#8221; on Saturday mornings.  My dad would even eat his with strawberry jam (ew).  Unfortunately (well, not that unfortunate) my freezer is full to bursting right now, so there&#8217;s no way I could possibly store the leftovers from this recipe.  It will have to wait.  You must have a gigantic freezer, or some very lucky neighbors.</p>

				<p>Even though I grew up in NJ I never really understood bialys growing up&#8211;they were always those things that weren&#8217;t as good as bagels. It wasn&#8217;t until later in life that I came to appreciate them as their own, unique and wonderful thing. Thank you for sharing a recipe!! Awesome!</p>

				<p>Thank you, thank you!  I used to live on these from a bakery next to my house when I lived in Vermont.  I credit them to my late 20s weight gain actually so maybe I shouldn&#8217;t be so excited;)  Since moving to the mid-west I cannot get good food anywhere nevermind a good Baily.  I asked someone once and they looked at me like I had two heads.  I am so excited to try this out, they look amazing.  Thanks one more time :)</p>

				<p>Here in Texas the kolache is very popular, served at conferences and meetings instead of donuts or bagels. What I love about kolaches is the super-salty dough &#8211; yum!

				<p>Those look really good!  I love baking things, so maybe I will have to try this recipe.  Bagels are a fun project, too, as well as soft pretzels.  Mmmmmmm. Arrg.  Why must I study for a math exam tomorrow when I could bake!  *.*  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you know of beer rocks?  These bialys sort of remind me of beer rocks, minus all onions and the ingredients are folded inside the dough.  My family makes a bread called beer rocks (usually with frozen dough since it is fast and comes in pre-made rolls*, but we also use actual beer bread) and then we cook up sausage, flatten the now risen rolls, and put a dollop of sausage inside it.  Then they&#8217;re turned into rolls again, let sit, and bake for a while.  They&#8217;re awesome with mustard.  Bialys could probably be made the same way, that way there&#8217;s not as much danger of the topping falling off/disintegrating while eating it.  Also there may be room for more of the mixture.  </p>
<p>*and yes, I know store bought bread is horrible most of the time and frozen bread dough ought to be horrible, but what the heck.  It works and it is actually fairly decent.  No substitute for real bread though.</p>

				<p>Hmn&#8230;.these almost sound exactly like green onion buns, a Chinese bakery food. Here in the San Gabriel Valley of California, Chinese bakeries are plentiful, and sell all sorts of delicious Asian baked goods, ranging from the &#8220;milk butter&#8221; bun (a bun with a creamy, buttery filling that is hard and crumbly and possibly contains coconut milk) to the previously mentioned green onion bun. This is basically a typical Chinese bun, topped with tons of grease and green onions, which are in some sort of thick non-sweet butter.</p>

				<p>These bialys look delicious.  I apologize for going off topic but I am trying to get back to the cream cheese pound cake in a bundt pan.  I can&#8217;t seem to retrieve it.  I tried going to the post itself (continued after jump is broken), tried your index (the link just won&#8217;t open), tried google index (still won&#8217;t open) and wonder what the problem could be.  Any ideas?  Usually when I see an exciting recipe I copy and paste to write mail and send it to myself so I can have a hard copy of just the recipe.  I didn&#8217;t copy while I was reading it since I had to go buy some of the ingredients.  Rats!  Would someone please advise if they too are having trouble with retrieving older recipes?</p>

				<p>AWESOME POST!  I as well love my bialys.  I never thought about making them but maybe I&#8217;ll give it a try.  My wife never understood why I raved and raved about this &#8220;bagel&#8221;&#8230;..but now she knows.  There is a great place here in Chicago that does a good job with bialys.  Its called New York Bagel and Bialys&#8230;go figure!</p>

				<p>I never gave bialys much thought either because I hated the onion taste (especially when I was young). I&#8217;m a bagel girl myself. But, your bialys do look very authentic!</p>

				<p>Just took the bialys out of the oven.  They came out great! Didn&#8217;t have poppy seed so I used black sesame seeds which added a nice flavor. They are not like the oversized ones you normally see but i like the smaller size.  I will double the batch next time. Also looking for a flagel ( flat, thin bagel) recipe, I guess similar to the flat bialy.<br />
Thanks for the post.  Great blog!</p>

				<p>My presumption was not in regards to feeling that the rest of the country is provincial &#8212; I think you read me wrong. It was because, as this comment section reflects, a lot of people I speak to outside the city have never heard of them, and it seemed silly to discuss them as if they were something eveyone knew and loved.</p>

				<p>You can get bialys in Eugene, Oregon at a lovely place called Humble Bagel, at the corner of&#8230; I think 19th(?) and Hilyard.</p>
<p>You can get bialys in the Midwest if you&#8217;re willing to trek into Chicago. Kosher bakeries are all over the West Rogers Park neighborhood, such as Tel Aviv Kosher Bakery, which has good bialys.</p>
<p>I never got mine from either place, though, because they always have poppy seeds in them. I know it&#8217;s authentic, but I hate poppy seeds. When I want bialys, I make them myself, and use toasted or black sesame seeds in place of the poppy seeds, and add a bit of garlic to the caramelized onions.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;ve got about two pounds of whole wheat flour and no white flour in the house, and I need to get rid of them before the weekend (Passover time!). Would that work for bialys, or should I just stick with the usual &#8220;use up the whole wheat&#8221; recipe for no-knead bread?</p>

				<p>I never heard of these, but hey, I live in Belgium. I recently had my very first bagel and fell in love with them &#8211; now the store has run out of stock (it was a special promo thing) and I can&#8217;t find any bagels anywhere. I&#8217;ll definitely try to make these bialys as they seem less troublesome than making bagels and certainly as delicious.</p>

				<p>I believe Kossar&#8217;s had a store on 14th St. between 1st and A when I lived in a rathole tenement apt. in a building right next door on flight up. This was in 1982. The smell of burnt flour would seep through my floorboards. Although I bought them occasionally to gnaw on anxiously as I tried to forget about the junkies shooting up in the hallway just outside my door, I can&#8217;t say I was ever magically transported by them. I think it&#8217;s a race-memory thing. Just as you are underwhelmed by southern cornbread, Deb, for me the bialy is, &#8220;Ehh?&#8221; Now, that said, am I the first person to point out that in the movie &#8220;The Producers,&#8221; Zero Mostel&#8217;s character&#8217;s name is Max Bialystock? The artichokes will be made tonight!</p>

				<p>These look awesome!  After eating my fair share of bagels in my lifetime I finally teamed up with my mom to make my grandmother&#8217;s recipe a few months ago.  I&#8217;m definitely going to give bialys a shot next &#8211; especially since you don&#8217;t have to mess with the boiling step.</p>

				<p>Aah Bread flour&#8230; Not available in my local French supermarket. Only a &#8220;preparation pour pain&#8221;. Which already has the yeast added. So now I&#8217;m in a quandary and my husband is crying out for Bialys.</p>
<p>Do I use the &#8220;preparation&#8221; and omit the first part of step one OR use &#8220;Farine de Ble&#8221; &#8211; plain flour &#8211; and hope for the best?</p>
<p>Any ideas??</p>

				<p>Are gluten additives available? Many shops here sell gluten powders that you can add to regular flours to make them just like bread flour. I often use <a href="http://www.bobsredmill.com/product.php?productid=3552&#038;cat=106&#038;page=1" rel="nofollow">Bob&#8217;s Red Mill</a> at home.</p>

				<p>I used regular old bread flour, which I don&#8217;t have trouble finding at Whole Foods and even the regular grocery stores by me. You can buy <a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/king-arthur-organic-high-gluten-flour-3-lb" rel="nofollow">King Arthur&#8217;s High Gluten Flour</a> on their web site, or go to your local bagel shop and beg them for a few cups (I did this when I made bagels).</p>

				<p>omg deb! i just finished making (and eating) these.  Yum.  Just yum.</p>
<p>Question:  I used regular bread flour from the store, but I have some Vital Wheat Gluten here.  I see you mentioning gluten powders above&#8230;  Is this something I could add to my dough to increase the gluten?  If so, how much?  Any idea?</p>

				<p>Oh, this makes my heart sing! I miss bialys, especially the vegetarian sandwich, the Buttermilk Bialy, from Ithaca Bakery that is made on a crispy bialy. I&#8217;ve never seen them outside New York. I will certainly save your recipe and try them, either in England where I live right now, or Texas where I&#8217;m heading next!! Thank you so much for sharing!</p>

				<p>To my friends from Texas here who are comparing kolaches to bialys &#8211; no comparison. The kolaches that I&#8217;ve eaten in central Texas are much more moist and sweetbread-y (although not always sweet) than the quite dry, bread-like bialy. I will take either any day! Love them both! </p>
<p>Jenifer from Houston &#8211; I do suggest a field trip to NYC to explore the differences. It&#8217;s quite important that one experience these things rather than just read! Armchair travelers don&#8217;t get all the good flavors!</p>

				<p>So I tried the recipe. I was disappointed that the dough didn&#8217;t rise must with the first rise and thought my bread was to be rock hard and a flop. I was still ready to eat it, rocks topped with onions, after baking. The second rise proved better and after baking, marvelous!! My husband and I thought the taste was similar to our fave Chinese scallion pancakes, even though the vehicle different. This recipe really does make a beautiful dough, one that bakers dream of.</p>

				<p>I wish I had seen your post  before I went to visit my (unemployed) nephew in Manhattan in February. My grandfather was from Bialystok, though, thankfully, he left in the early 1900s. I had read The Bialy Eaters, but didn&#8217;t realize Kossar&#8217;s had gone downhill. I made a special pilgrimage there and was very disappointed. Dry and almost no onion on top. There is a shiny new Whole Foods a couple blocks away in the lower east side that carries some better bialys.  I think there is nothing to be done but try to make these at home! Thanks for your post!</p>

				<p>Thank you so much Deb for posting this recipe!</p>
<p>I followed the link for the book and read- in disgust- that the comment was that this lady who wrote the book &#8220;went to Poland&#8221; and to &#8220;Argentina&#8221; (MY HOME COUNTRY) and &#8220;couldn&#8217;t find the true Bialy!&#8221; I was so disgusted I will definitely NOT buy the book! In Argentina we call them PLETZE/PLETZALAJ and they are THE BEST. And a dear friend who traveled to Poland and to Lithuania DID find them and they were great! So I am dissapointed that an &#8220;american-centered writer&#8221; who believes that HER take on how a bialy should be like is THE ULTIMATE one (and can&#8217;t find any that compare to that) is just a self-centered pompous ass! </p>
<p>And HOW LONG did that lady spent in Buenos Aires in order to FIND OUT if there were there or not? Shame on her! But she probably made some money and as some reviewers said- got some free trips- just so she could criticize anything that was not like what SHE expected to be?  What a silly woman! </p>
<p>The only thing I would be interested about the book- for if anyone cares for commenting on that- is where in Miami they can be found. I know the ones at &#8220;epicure&#8221; (they go under a different name) but they are kind of hard, hard to split in half and not that great. </p>
<p>Anyhow- maybe you liked the book and it is not that bad. I hope it is not as badly researched as the review made it look!</p>
<p>Most important than all the above:  I very much enjoy your blog- thanks for it!</p>

				<p>I made these yesterday&#8230; I was certain that I&#8217;d mess them up somehow, because it was only my second time making bread, but oh my goodness these are AMAZING. I&#8217;m a third-generation native New Yorker so I know my way around a bialy, and one of these, still warm from the oven, slathered with butter on top? Best bialy I&#8217;ve ever had. This recipe must be foolproof if I was able to obtain these results!</p>
<p>One note &#8212; I think my oven tends to run hot, so for the first batch (I baked in two sets of three) I had the dial set to 450. Those bialys turned out perfectly shaped, but they took more than 10 minutes to bake through. So for the next batch, I turned the dial up to near 475 &#8212; the bialys baked in the appropriate amount of time, but the centers puffed up and the filling spilled out. So it seems that temperature has something to do with whether the centers puff up, as well.</p>

				<p>wow, talk about timely! My father is getting ready to retire from NJ, where i grew up, to VA, where i live now. One of our regrets is that he won&#8217;t be able to get bialys down here. (The other is an abscence of good Jewish seeded rye bread.) In NJ you walk into the grocery store and buy them from the freezer case with no special effort. Here i haven&#8217;t found them for years. Wegmans grocery store just came to the area and sell bialys, but they&#8217;re like glorified &#8220;kaiser rolls,&#8221; nothing like real bialys should be. My father has baked bread before and so have i, so i sense a wonderful family baking experience in our near future! Thank you for this fine article.</p>

				<p>We can get pretty good ones here from our little Mr. Bagel chain. I wonder though&#8230;is there a &#8220;right&#8221; way to eat them? I don&#8217;t toast them, cream cheese, piece of lettuce, thin slice of tomato, and a paper thin ring or two of red onion&#8230;with a grind or two of salt&#8230;it&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve always done and loved&#8230;</p>

				<p>Eastern Europe &#8211; that&#8217;s the birthplace of all these wonderful breads.  I recall my grandmother making bialy&#8217;s, pierogis, (nothing like the fresh one) beet soup iwth sour cream, and potatoe pancakes and kasha.  There is no way they are as good unless the come from raw grated, small grate, potatoes.  </p>
<p>Most of all is the dark rye bread.  As a child we would go a distance to the only place that made is authentically.  I believe the bread had to rise in wooden kegs.  Not sure what they were, the kegs, I seem to reacall they had been previously use.</p>

				<p>Love your site,  and your recipes.. but, uhm&#8230; gosh, there IS a world outside of NYC?!   Yes, in fact bialys *are* well known outside of NYC.  Especially in Chicago &#8211; given the vast Jewish population here.  Some of the best Jewish deli&#8217;s outside of NYC are here.  (Skokie anyone?)  I grew up on onion bialys, and they were always my favorite choice.. I just always wished I could get more of that onion center, that I had to ration out so carefully for each bite. This post is nice encouragement to now make my own. Keep up the great work&#8230; and don&#8217;t forget about the rest of us out in the land-beyond-NYC.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m really excited to try this. Among Argentinean Jews we call them &#8220;Pletzalech&#8221; and we eat the with mayo, smoked beef brisket and sliced pickles. If you make the bialys small, these little sandwiches can be great finger food.</p>

				<p>Hi there! i&#8217;m suprised to see my homecity special bialys recipe in here. You say that is popular in NY?  That&#8217;s like insane. But, people, it&#8217;s rediculous to say, that to taste the real bialys you have to go to NY.<br />
You should come for REAL ones to Bia?ystok, try the ones in tiny restaurant in historic city hall.<br />
You should know also that ESPERANTO was created here.<br />
Take care !</p>

				<p>I baked my bialys this morning and they really turned out great! Thanks!!! Here in Memphis, I don&#8217;t think there is anywhere to get them &#8211; not even Whole Foods. I did the first rise last night, then after forming the individual rolls, I put them in fridge over night. I did use extra sea salt in the dough and it is just right&#8230; thanks for the heads up on that. This morning I pulled them out and let the second rise begin. When I went to pull the plastic off the top of them and add the filling, I almost panicked b/c the plastic had totally stuck to the tops of them, even though I did flour the top of them before covering. When I pulled the plastic away, it tore the rolls and they deflated&#8230; sooo I was certain I was going to have little frisbees instead of little bialys. But by the time the topping was ready and oven was heated, they had recovered. I baked them and they came out beautiful. Chewy with a nice crust. So thanks!!!! Have a great week!</p>

				<p>Just made these. I, apparently, pinched my centers even less efficiently than you, because they puffed up even more. This may be because I was afraid of deflating the dough, so instead of picking them up and pinching them, I put them on the sheet and pushed down in the centers. They were still unbelievably delicious, though! Thanks!</p>

				<p>I am so excited to try this recipe! (I recently tried a bialys recipe from a book called A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking. Probably through my own error and inexperience, the baked goods came out tasty enough, but in no way resembled a bialys.) However, the directions about the KitchenAid mixer are causing me some consternation. My KitchenAid manual very sternly says never to knead dough on any speed but #2, let alone knead for 7 minutes on speed #4. Are we at odds because we have different KitchenAids (I have the KitchenAid 5 quart 475 watt stand mixer) or because the KitchenAid manual and forum are overly cautious? Thank you!</p>

				<p>My family is from Bialystock and we&#8217;ve been baking bialies for generations. They&#8217;re always a New Year&#8217;s Day tradition for us, not sure why. In any case, if you&#8217;re worried about the mixer KNEAD THE DOUGH BY HAND! It takes about 8 minutes. Just dump the sticky, floury mess on a well floured countertop and keep turning, folding and kneading in flour untill the dough is no longer sticky and is smooth and elastic. I promise you that bialies have been around far longer than any kitchenaid and the pleasure of kneading and forming bialies by hand can not be beat.</p>

				<p>Enjoyed reading your recipe.  As a transplanted New Yorker now living in California, I will admit to being obsessed with obtaining the perfect bialy recipe.  For a more authentic taste, I have had success by adding just a small amount of sugar to the recipe (as does George Greenstein in &#8220;Secrets of a Jewish Bread Baker&#8221;) (I use 1 teaspoon for 12 bialys).  I recommend that the shaping be done more like shaping a pizza, as in the &#8220;Bread Cetera&#8221; recipe, but leave the outer edge thicker than a pizza &#8211; the total width before baking should be around 5&#8243;, with the edge around 1-1.5 inches.  After placing the filling, allow to rise until a little puffy, which will make the bialy look smoother than your photos.  Lastly, with all of that work, why make only 6 bialys?</p>

				<p>Just made your bialys for a party.  No one knew what they were, but what a favorite!  The party host eventually cut them in forths so everyone could get a sample.</p>
<p>Improvised a little.  Put finely minced rosemary in the dough.  I hand kneaded the dough for 10 minutes with lots of stretching.  I have a new yet inferior oven.   On the lowest shelf I placed a 12 X 9 X 2 cake pan filled with water, I used the next shelf for baking.  Preheated the oven with my cookie trays in it.   Shaped and filled the bialys on parchment then moved quickly to place it onto the very hot cookie trays.   Baked, spritzed with water and turned the trays every three minutes or so&#8230;.  As my oven doesn&#8217;t distribute heat well&#8230;   I waited until 190 temp, about 15 minutes.  </p>
<p>Delicious, the best recipe I have found&#8230; The appearance, the texture&#8230;</p>
<p>THANKS!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m in the process of making these right now! My bialys totally stuck to the plastic wrap (even though I floured their tops), and then deflated when I had to peel them off.  So next time I will just cover with a damp towel instead, I think&#8230; just waiting for the oven to heat! the filling smells so good&#8230; i love sauteed onions! will check back to tell you how it goes!</p>

				<p>they turned out fantastic! just a note&#8230; make sure the pan you toss the ice cubes in is made of metal and not glass because if you toss ice cubes into a hot glass pan it will shatter. I found this out the hard way. :(</p>

				<p>I swear, I did everything wrong making this recipe.  I forgot to mix the flour and yeast until I&#8217;d added half the salt.  I used regular flour instead of bread flour.  I used active dry yeast instead of instant.  I added extra flour and mixed it extra long because the dough seemed so soft and wet.  The plastic wrap stuck to the tops of my bialys on the second rise.  I just poked the centers in instead of shaping them because the one I managed to peel off the sheet looked so flat and sad afterwards.  That meant that I baked them on the metal sheet instead of on my baking stone.</p>
<p>And damn it all if they didn&#8217;t turn out lovely despite my best efforts to screw them up.</p>

				<p>First homemade chocolate wafers and now homemade bialys!  You are too much.  Btw, I grew up right near Kossar&#8217;s but haven&#8217;t been in a long time&#8230; now that I moved all the way to the other end of the island (Morningside Heights)!  Only in New York would 5 miles or so be a schlep but it&#8217;s over an hour on public transportation!</p>

				<p>My family eats bialys and bagels almost daily, so I wanted to share my tip for heating:  Ideally, you would eat it immediately out of the oven, but if that&#8217;s not possible, freeze immediately.  To reheat, bake at 350 degrees for 12 minutes.  It takes almost like it did when it was first cooked.  If it burns, you know that it was all air and not worthy to begin with; if it&#8217;s still cold in the middle then you&#8217;ve got yourself one dense bialy and please post your recipe!  Regarding Kossar&#8217;s, I was so excited to see their bialys in the frozen section at my ShopRite, unfortunately, when I got them home, the center was empty&#8211;not a single poppyseed.  It&#8217;s a shame they&#8217;ve declined in recent years, and I regret never getting up there when they were still good.</p>

				<p>Just a note for some who are making them and have no experience with commerical bialys to compare theisr with:  as Texas girl on the Lower East Side in the 90&#8217;s, the kosher onion bialys kind of reminded me of a onion english muffin.  but much, much better.  So, yes, a bialy can be a little drier and chewier than you expect.  Not really a pastry, more of a bread.  And so stinkin&#8217; good with toasted with honey drizzled on top.</p>
