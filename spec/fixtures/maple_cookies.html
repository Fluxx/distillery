Every December, I make you a promise in my head that this, <i>this!</i> will be the year that I share a recipe for classic sugar cookies, the kind that you can roll into any shape your heart desires and sprinkle, then ice, glitter and bauble merrily into the New Year and this year was no different. But then December arrives and my cooking dance card is absolutely bursting with offers to fill your internet quota with cocktails and party snacks and wrappable candies and so, so many cookies. Cookies with butter and chocolate, cookies with puddles of mint; cookies with hazelnuts and blackberries or white chocolate and ginger and <i>butterscotch</i>, people. Is it any wonder that I always lose sight of loftier baking goals each year when faced with the prospect of butterscotch-crunched cookies?</p>

<p>As you can probably tell, I&#8217;m having a great time. I briefly wondered when I handed in my manuscript what I would do with <i>all of that free time</i> for the five weeks it is in the hands of some sainted copyeditor. I shouldn&#8217;t have worried, in part because I have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/6466821167/in/photostream">one of these</a>, and also because of butter; I am actually biding my time with boxes and boxes of butter. My daily vista is whipped butter, faintly sparkled with granulated sugar clinging to a KitchenAid paddle before an avalanche of flour and spices puff their way up from the attached bowl. My freezer is packed with layers upon layers of cookies between sheets of waxed paper in airtight containers, eagerly awaiting the party invitations that will surely come flooding in now that, for the first time in the history of my disorganized life, I am actually ready for them.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re inviting me to your holiday party, right? Okay, <em>phew</em>. I might bring these. They look really plain, don&#8217;t they? But they are a tumble of butter and maple syrup, crackly sea salt and a whiff of nutmeg. They are the exact reason that I cannot bring myself to make ordinary sugar cookies, not when cookies like this exist. There&#8217;s a lot of maple syrup in there, which is one of my favorite things on earth and yet I have to retire my Maple Syrup Fanatic Club Card because apparently, I&#8217;ve been buying it all wrong. In school, a report card full of A&#8217;s (not that I ever saw one) was vastly superior than one cluttered with B&#8217;s and so, like most people, I assumed that Grade A maple syrup was the best you could get. I was so misled! Grade B is like maple syrup raised to the most maple syrup power (with math summaries like this, my report cards should surprise you less) &#8212; it is loud with the cool, almost smoky sweetness of dark maple syrup and it makes these cookies work. Maple syrup has such a subtle flavor that it&#8217;s often lost in baked goods, no matter how much you use. Not here. Here, it lingers and plays off of sea salt and nutmeg in a thin, tender when warm, crisp when cool, intensely buttery cookie. Oh, and I used generic, on sale, store brand butter. Could you imagine what the fancier butters would do for this cookie? I&#8217;m almost afraid to find out.</p>

<p><b>Nutmeg Maple Butter Cookies</b><br />
Adapted, just a smidge, from the late great <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Maple-Leaf-Butter-Cookies-10106">Gourmet Magazine</a></p>
<p>1 cup (2 sticks or 226 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />
1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar<br />
1/2 cup (118 ml) maple syrup (Grade B is ideal here, but the original recipe suggested that Grade A with a few drops of maple extract would also work)<br />
1 large egg yolk<br />
3 cups (375 grams) all-purpose flour<br />
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg or 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (because it packs more tightly)<br />
1 1/4 teaspoon flaky salt or 1 teaspoon table salt</p>
<p>Using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. With mixer running, add yolk and slowly drizzle in maple syrup. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, nutmeg and salt. Add to butter mixture and mix until just combined. The dough will be in loose clumps. Gather them together into a tight packet with a large piece of plastic wrap and chill dough for at least two hours (and up to four days) until firm.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a few baking sheets with parchment paper. I like to roll out a quarter to half  the dough at a time, leaving the rest in the fridge. On a floured counter, roll dough to 1/8-inch thickness and cut into desired shapes.</p>
<p>(I started with conservative circles, moved into ridged circles, then maple leaves and then, after reading a fascinating article about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/nyregion/boom-and-bust-in-acorns-will-affect-many-creatures-including-humans.html">the acorn harvest this year</a>, got forrest-ed away with acorns and oak leaves that a reader sent me a few years ago. Not that you asked any of this.)</p>
<p>Arrange cookies on baking sheets and bake for 8 to 11 minutes each, or until lightly golden at the edges. Transfer to racks to cool. Cookies keep in airtight containers for a week, or in the freezer until their dance number is up.</p>

				<p>These look so delicious!! And I love how simple yet decadent they are. Oh and totally agree with you about the Maple Syrup &#8211; I originally thought that Grade A was the best, but Grade B is so much more rich!</p>

				<p>The other half asked for &#8220;butter cookies&#8221; for the Christmas cookie month after my batch of your Gingersnaps ran out. I might just indulge him once we collect our larger pants as a result of those containers of David Leite&#8217;s consummate ones I baked last night. You&#8217;re back with a vengeance woman!</p>

				<p>Well, butter and maple syrup are two of the best ingredients on earth, so I think it&#8217;s safe to assume these are going to taste like heaven! I might just have to add these to my cookie baking list this year!!</p>

				<p>Freezing baked cookies &#8212; This is actually the first year I&#8217;ve done this so I&#8217;m not an expert. But I just pack them as tightly as possible in container and layer waxed paper between them and on top, beneath the lid. If you wanted to be extra careful, you could cover the top with plastic wrap tightly before putting the lid on. But I know that butter-heavy baked goods tend to freeze well so I think they should taste great once they&#8217;re defrosted. And nothing will be in the freezer for more than a few weeks.</p>
<p>Cookie cutters &#8212; <s><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/6467157657/in/photostream" rel="nofollow">Here&#8217;s a photo of the acorn one</a>. These plastic, spring-topped ones are <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/shop/bakeware/cookie-cutters-pancake-molds/" rel="nofollow">definitely sold at Williams-Sonoma</a>, but I think they&#8217;re just doing Christmas-y and branded kids stuff right now. I&#8217;m impressed with the shapes, though. There was also a tiny maple leaf in the set but I couldn&#8217;t get it to work without sticking terribly. I think it had too many leaf lines.</s> <b>Updated to note:</b> Actually, you can buy cookie cutters almost exactly like the ones I used from Williams-Sonoma. <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/fall-pie-cutters/?pkey=ccooking-sale" rel="nofollow">They&#8217;re on sale right now</a>. The set is a little different from the one I have but in some ways better &#8212; the maple leaf looks less intricate  (I used the maple leaf from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fox-Run-7-Piece-Cookie-Cutter/dp/B001ET5YSE/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323196832&amp;sr=8-5" rel="nofollow">this set</a> instead. It&#8217;s very tiny, like 1-inch and the stem is eager to break off when you cut them. Yes, I have kind of a ridiculous number of cookie cutters.) and like it would work better and there&#8217;s a turkey too! The acorn has a different, but also adorable design on it.</p>
<p>P.S. Now I&#8217;m coveting <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/kransekaka-star-cookie-cutter-set/?pkey=ccookie-cutters-pancake-molds" rel="nofollow">these star shapes</a> as well. They are so delightfully rounded. I have a star cookie cutter but the corners are so narrowly pointed, the cookies break too easily.</p>

				<p>I am so excited to go home and make these. I love nutmeg but it always ends up being such a background player. I imagine with maple syrup it would be center stage, but in a nice plays-well-with-others kind of way. Would these work as a slice and bake? I am horrible at cookies that have to be rolled out, and I love having logs of frozen cookie dough ready to bake fresh.</p>

				<p>Maple syrup grades run from Fancy (lightest in color and taste), Grade A Medium Amber, Grade A Dark Amber, Grade B (darkest in color and taste). They all have the same sugar percentage but the lightest syrup is produced earliest in the sugaring season (springtime) and gets progressively darker as the season progresses. Fancy acquired the name &#8220;Fancy&#8221; because it was desirable to have a sweetener that could replace cane sugar at at time when it was costly or hard to come by (perhaps during the Depression). That&#8217;s why the lighter colors have a higher grade. Personally, I like Fancy over vanilla ice cream or on pancakes or in drinks, when you&#8217;re consuming it as-is. The darker grades are better for cooking or baking when you do want a pronounced maple flavor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m from Vermont so I&#8217;m required to know this ;) In the Spring, Vermont has a Maple Open House weekend where sugar houses across the state open their doors to the public and you can witness sugar making first hand. But be warned- sugaring coincides with Mud Season.</p>

				<p>I love these already. Love the maple leaves&#8211;I actually had 20 minutes of panic Thanksgiving morning when I couldn&#8217;t find my maple leaf cutter.</p>
<p>Speaking of butter, you would not believe my excitement last month when Costco started carrying unsalted butter quarters. For $2.10 and pound. And organic heavy cream. $2.99 a HALF GALLON. It&#8217;s like the universe is telling me to bake.</p>
<p>Excited for my school semester to be complete next week. From then on, it will just be baking cookies with the kiddo, and finishing baking this other kiddo for another month.</p>

				<p>Amy &#8212; That is such awesome information. Thank you! When I was little and good maple syrup was harder to come by, my mother had her friend who visited family in Vermont every year bring back metal jugs we&#8217;d use all year. That&#8217;s how serious we were about having the very best for our pancakes. But I obviously had the grade information all wrong. I also like it as a sweetener for oatmeal (we put it on Jacob&#8217;s everyday) and plain, Greek yogurt. </p>
<p>Jill B &#8212; Do you mean the glass one? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00478P5WE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=smitten-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00478P5WE" rel="nofollow">It&#8217;s from Anchor Hocking</a>. I liked it so much that I bought the 2-cup too. Total frivolity; I already had glass measuring cups but couldn&#8217;t resist these. The triple spouts are great too. Search around and you&#8217;ll find it from someplace that does free shipping, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>Meleyna &#8212; I hear you. It often costs an arm and a leg in NYC. (My local bodega? $7 for a pound of cheap butter, oof.) I started buying it at Whole Foods when they standardized the price at $2.69 or something. Now it&#8217;s $3.something but still not bad.</p>

				<p>Do you think that these would work well as icebox cookies?  I have a bizarre aversion to rolling out cookie dough &#8212; the cookies made from re-rolled scraps are never as good as those cut out on the first pass.</p>

				<p>Hey Deb/ anyone else who&#8217;s interested in the acorn cookie cutters &#8211; I actually just found them on the William Sonoma site, they&#8217;re just in the sale section under &#8220;Fall Piecrust Cutters&#8221;. They are part of a set and the acorn &#8220;texture&#8221; is slightly different, but still cute.</p>

				<p>This &#8220;white chocolate and ginger and butterscotch..&#8221; is so me!</p>
<p>But these cookies look divine.  They are PERFECT, too.  Like&#8230;little works of edible art.  Too pretty to eat&#8230;well, almost  :)</p>

				<p>Ooh&#8230;I always make sugar cookies but I think they might get bumped this year! Or, since you (and my mother-in-law) have been a questionable influence on me, I can just make both and freeze them. And then make Oreos. And icebox cake. And gingerbread cookies. And cucidati&#8230;.and maybe seven-layer cookies if I&#8217;m feeling particularly masochistic. </p>
<p>PS- Despite having two sets of nesting mixing bowls, I just bought the Anchor Hocking 4-bowl set from Brooklyn Kitchen after ogling for a while. Now I might want that measuring cup&#8230; there&#8217;s a 3-piece set! (1/3/4 cup)</p>

				<p>long time reader, first time commenter (if that&#8217;s even a word) and i&#8217;ve been an associate at williams-sonoma for several years. we have the fall-themed cutters every year, but the shapes change each year too. For example, this year&#8217;s set included a very cute turkey shape. They&#8217;re actually piecrust cutters, but they work very well for other things too!</p>

				<p>This is a lot like my great-grandmother&#8217;s Scottish shortbread, except with the maple syrup and spices added.  Press and cut, and a whole lot of rich flavor.  I&#8217;ve been cooking and baking gluten free for six years now, so it&#8217;s been a challenge to really make that recipe work out the same.  I&#8217;ve pretty much abandoned it and let my mom take over.  But&#8230;I think the egg yolk may help it hold together a little better than just butter, flour, and sugar.  </p>
<p>This recipe looks great on it&#8217;s own, but maybe it can also help me come at my old family recipe kind of sideways with a new ingredient perspective.  Thanks so much for making me reconsider giving up on that!  </p>

				<p>My only experience with sugar cookies left me traumatized for life&#8230;  my beloved husband insisted we should make together his family recipe. BUT, he&#8217;s got this little quirk in his personality:  he never EVER scales a recipe down.   It was my first time making any type of cookies, as when I grew up in Brazil it was not part of end of the year festivities.</p>
<p>to make a long story short, we had cookies spread ALL OVER the house to dry and be decorated next day.   It took us hours and hours and hours working together, and after that I could not look at another sugar cookie for years  ;-)</p>
<p>it&#8217;s been long enough that I might make them again, but probably 1/4 of that recipe</p>
<p>(loved your version with the maple&#8230; fantastic, I am sure!)</p>

				<p>These look delicious! I make maple sugar cookies from a Martha Stewart recipe that amps up the maple flavor by brushing the cookies with maple syrup after they come out of the oven. It soaks in some but also leaves a wonderful maple coating on top. Since you&#8217;re also a maple lover, I thought I&#8217;d mention it!</p>

				<p>I *have* to make this recipe.  Last time we were in NH, I bought Grade B maple syrup to make the maple syrup cupcakes from the new Baked book, and we still have a ton of syrup left.  BTW, I have spring-loaded Halloween cookie cutters from W-S, and the recipe for sugar cookies on the back of it has become my go-to recipe (after trying MANY different recipes).  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also this cookie cutter from King Arthur (of course, I already bought a ton of stuff from them)<br />
<a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/leaf-cookie-cutter" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/leaf-cookie-cutter</a></p>
<p>Oh!  And through a google search, I found your Williams-Sonoma spring loaded maple leaf, on sale:<br />

				<p>The cookies look delicious.  I have frozen cookies for years.  I layer them with wax paper in Tupperware or Ziplock containers, or even plastic containers from the dollar store.  When I run out of freezer space, I just keep the containers on shelves in the garage (I live in the northeast, so it&#8217;s cold enough.) When it&#8217;s time for dessert, just put the frozen cookies on a plate and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>

				<p>Did you know that maple syrup is actually harvested in the spring? It&#8217;s thought of as such an autumnal flavor- thanksgiving pies, christmas cookies, etc- but primary harvest is in the spring, after sugars have been stored for the winter and when warmer temperatures start the sap flowing. Not to say that these cookies wouldn&#8217;t be delicious any time of year!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb. I have never frozen baked cookies before but find that unbaked ones freeze really well and then you only need less than a quarter of an hour to bake on the day. But, I trust you so much that I am thinking of trying to freeze baked ones. Honestly, do they taste as good?! Thank you.</p>

				<p>talia &#8212; I can&#8217;t give an accurate yield because my cookie cutters were all random sizes and I had a toddler stealing them as they came out of the oven. My estimate would be 100 1 1/2-inch cookies.</p>

				<p>I have organic cultured butter in the freezer and grade B maple syrup on its way in the mail and was just gifted with a woodland set of cookie cutters. And then I find THESE?! I&#8217;m usually not patient enough for cut-out cookies&#8230;. but goodness these seem worth the fuss. And since all those things fell into my lap along with this recipe, it seems like I&#8217;m being called to make my New England hubby some maple cookies. Thank you :)</p>

				<p>That sound you hear is me smacking my forehead. I never thought about the packing issue for pre-ground vs freshly ground nutmeg! I made your maple cream pie and was so disappointed by the overwhelming nutmeg taste that I haven&#8217;t made it again since. But this convinces me to give it another spin &#8211; thanks!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m like this with a lot of things when it comes to cooking/baking: why make the regular classic when thiiis version exists and is waiting to be tried out?! Thanks for sharing, your cookies look beautiful.</p>

				<p>Um, I think I can one up your maple syrup love. Embarrassing confession: I have, on more than one occasion and in need of a sweet treat with nothing of the sort in the house, taken a few glugs of organic Grade B maple syrup straight from the bottle. (I live alone so the cootie factor is minimized). I am a sick woman &#8230;.</p>

				<p>Perfect timing!  I just got a bunch of new cookie cutters as a Christmas gift and have been pondering what rolled cookies to make.  Where did you get your b-grade maple syrup?</p>

				<p>I recently baked sugar cookies from a different recipe for the first time. They turned out well, but my mother warned me that if I put the dough in the refrigerator to chill that the butter would harden into flakes within the dough and the cookies would not turn out. I would love to put the dough in the fridge to chill it, as you recommend here. Deb, was there any problem with the butter hardening or do you have any tips on that front? Thanks!</p>

				<p>If you want a REALLY GOOD classic sugar cookie recipe, try this one: <a href="http://indiedomestic.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/the-best-sugar-cookie-ever/" rel="nofollow">http://indiedomestic.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/the-best-sugar-cookie-ever/</a><br />
It&#8217;s from an old Betty Crocker cookbook from the 60&#8217;s, and it is a total winner.  I bake these all the time&#8230;but now I&#8217;m super stoked to try yours too.  I LOVE maple!</p>

				<p>If I can weigh in on the freezing of baked cookies? I have done so for years , in the exact manner Deb suggests.  Starting Dec 1, I make a batch a day after work, leave out a few for sampling, and freeze the rest.  I usually make eight to ten different types. </p>
<p>When I&#8217;m ready to gift a cookie platter, I arrange it with frozen cookies.  I&#8217;ve never had a problem with the defrosting of them one bit. By the time I wrap and add a bow, they&#8217;re defrosted and ready to go. </p>
<p>Honestly this is the best way to make large amounts of cookies and still have them be nice and fresh when you want them. They literally take minutes  to thaw out.</p>

				<p>Haha, I had thought the same thing about the maple syrup grades &#8211; finally, somewhere, a B is better than an A! :) These look incredible and I can see why you would pass up plain old sugar cookies. And I am always happy to eat anything filled with maple syrup and lots of butter!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br />
I was wondering your thoughts on subbing some of the regular sugar with maple sugar (boiled down Maple syurp).  I know the maple sugar is sweeter than regular sugar, but wasn&#8217;t sure how &#8220;sweet&#8221; these cookies are with the regular to make adjustments.</p>

				<p>Jut to follow up.  Saved enough dough to bake and they&#8217;re gone already.  A new family fave.  As pretty as the leaves are though, I&#8217;m afraid these will become a slice and bake standard.  Quick and easy.</p>

				<p>Adam &#8212; You&#8217;re supposed to. I rarely do. Then again, I often leave out my butter too long, so I figure the egg&#8217;s cooling properties might be a good thing.</p>
<p>Heidi &#8212; These cookies are actually pretty sweet (it&#8217;s why I like the amped up sea salt effect) so I wouldn&#8217;t add any sweetness if possible.</p>
<p>Emily &#8212; Honestly, I probably would have just deferred to Martha on something like sugar cookies. She seems like the place to go for the Christmas classics.</p>
<p>Kris K. &#8212; A little embarrassed because I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a wealth of lovely local merchants in the city that sell it, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013E7C0S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0013E7C0S" rel="nofollow">I ordered it from Amazon</a>. Realized last week it was December, I wanted to make these cookies very badly and didn&#8217;t want to run all over the place looking for the good stuff. It arrived in three days &#8212; win.</p>
