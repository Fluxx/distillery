      Posted on 2011-04-23 16:23:15
      <p>Currently in my Plants vs Zombies clone I have been steadily adding characters and working on graphical improvements. Currently before I get too far into the game I've decided with some advice to re-theme the game. I might even have an artist who will join in the creation of this game. With the potential inclusion of another person into the project I've been working on setting up very basic layout of more characters with the theme in mind to add a lot of choices in creation. I've been thinking on how much art work needs to be done for my project, and the scale is daunting.</p>

<p>In this game I want several things to be included. I'm going to list it in a list because that is what a list is fore. If you don't list things in a list then the list will look silly as it will just run on and on. The running on I am talking about is very much like this paragraph, but that is just for added effect. By the way did I mention the new theme is pirates fighting aliens?</p>

<ul>
<li>Background Image (What everything is drawn upon) which includes the water / sand / boat / bushes</li>
<li>Background Effects (Moving parts of the background) which includes the water near the edges and some grass</li>
<li>Menu items (The information block, plant picker, and buttons) which the buttons will have to have two states (clicked and unclicked)</li>
<li><s>Plants</s> Pirates (The characters themselves with their multiple animations)</li>
<li><s>Seeds</s> Bullets/cannonballs/barrels/rum (Anything the pirates use to attack)</li>
<li><s>Zombies</s> Aliens (The baddie stuff that tries to steal your booty, oh no!)</li>
<li>Effects (muzzle flair, smoke, explosions, spilled rum *sniff*)</li>
<li>Foreground (Anything above the playing field) like birds and clouds as extra effect</li>
<li>You Win (The cool image that displays whenever you might win The Game)</li>
<li>You Lose (The cool image that displays whenever you might lose) probably a sad pirate next to an empty chest</li>
<li>A Logo (Something I can plop up at the start of the game and include in the download page / advertising)</li>
</ul>

<p>To give you an idea of how big this is, I'm having each animated item like the waves and grass to have about four frames. A default, two building up, and a return frame. It gives a fairly good result to have four frames to work with, as I can have movement every 1/4th frame, every other, or every one is different. The pirates and aliens are a bit different but still employ the four frame method. There is the default frame, three idle frames, and three attacking frames. The character will loop through the idle frames while they aren't attacking, and when they attack they loop through the other. There might be a need to include another set of frames for the aliens for a standing still animation so they don't look like they are walking in place, but that can be added at a later date.</p>

<p>Not only do I want to have seven frames per character, but I also want them to show how close to dying they are. When they have over half their health they will look normal, when it dips below 50% they start to show signs of wearing down. When it finally drops below 25% the wear and tear will definitely be showing. This means that there will have to be 21 separate images per character (on the same sheet). So say we have six pirates and four aliens, that is 210 sprites. This included with the four waves, and about three plants is now up to 226. Finally adding everything else but the effects we reach around 240.</p>

<img src="/pictures/NewThemesBackground.png" alt="A picture of the new theme.">

<p>Finally for the effects. I'll be continuing the four frame thing here as well, thought it might get boosted to six for a greater range of effects joy (depending on how big we end up making them). If there is about five effects, that brings the total up to 260 separate images! Now a lot of these (pirates and aliens) can be mostly copied, pasted, then tweaked. However still that is a tall order, especially since I want more then six pirates and aliens.</p>

<p>This is a general idea of how big a project just a simple "for fun" thing I end up doing. A 3D game would not be very much worse as there are several textures per character and object, you can reuse those textures on more than just one character or object though. Surprisingly enough, 300 or so images is not that large, as some of the bigger games (Unreal Tournament 2004 for example) can have a few thousand textures / images. Don't be discouraged though as making your game look better should be fun instead of tedious. I mostly add or change the different pictures / sheets when I feel like it so it is less of a chore, as you can imaging everything gets a ton of revisions until it makes the final cut.</p>

<p>I hope this insight doesn't discourage anyone, you might try making a less graphical game (machines don't have to move to look right). I really suggest partnering up with a graphic artist though, it sure does get annoying when you want to program in animations / new characters but you have to make a picture for them before you can really get a feel for their precise attributes (health, speed, damage).</p>

<p>Finally I have released an alpha test of the game (uploaded it yesterday before theme change was planned). You can download it from <a href="http://www.blog.knolif.com/Lawn-Vs-Aliens-Download/">its download page</a>. Also I'd love some feedback, you can never get enough feedback.</p>
